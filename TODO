* BUG: Go to a homework's own page
   * Only show criterion on own page...
* Make criteria editing snazzier...

DONE:
* Add an interface to edit a homework
* Add a way to mark things as done...
* Sort by priority..
   * Things that haven't been done come first
   * Sort by ascending due date (soonest first).
