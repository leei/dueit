== DueIt - Keep Track of What I Need to Do...

DueIt allows you to keep track of when your homework is due.  You can
associate any object with a due date and it will track what's due, when and
notify you about what's coming up.

Classes or Projects can be created and shared with other users. Within these,
any new Dues will be shared by everyone, including whatever's associated with
them.
